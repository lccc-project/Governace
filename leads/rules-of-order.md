# LCCC Leadership Rules of Order and Governance Procedures

## Declaration of Role of the Leadership

The Role of the Leadership is to ensure Order and Good Governance of the LCCC Project in the trust and good reasoning of the Project Members and Community Members.

## Public Decision Making Preferred

The Leadership of LCCC shall, in the furthurance of the stated goal, prefer to make all decisions publicly, in a manner that is available for the review and comment of all members of the LCCC Project, and it shall be presumed that the whole of the LCCC Project benefits from a decision being made publically.

The above presumption may be defeated only on clear and convincing evidence that a private decision is either necessary, or the interests of the whole of the LCCC Project or the whole of Lightning Creations demand a private decision.

With the exception of a Referendum Vote, which necessarily must be held in public, the method of voting used does not affect whether a decision may be made privately.

## Voting Methods

There are multiple methods to conduct certain votes. Unless otherwise specified, the Leads making a motion may define which voting method is used.

### Majority Vote

A Majority Leadership Vote may be taken for most changes to the LCCC Project. All Leads must acknowledge and respond to the vote, or a sufficient number must respond to guarantee a majority. After both the required number of Leads have responded and a majority vote is obtained, a 24-hour final comment period occurs, after which a majority of the voting Leads must have voted in favour, where any Leads who did not vote is considered to have abstained.
In the case of a private decision, the final comment period may be waived once a majority has been achieved provided no Lead objects to the waiver.

### Unanimous Votes

A Unanimous Leadership Vote may be taken for especially dangerous, irreversible, or sensitive decisions that cannot be taken lightly. 

All Leads must acknowledge and must have responded in favor or abstained. After all Leads have acknowledged and all voting Leads are in favor, a 24-hour final comment period occurs, after which all voting Leads must remain in favor. 
In the case of a private decision, the final comment period may be waived once unanimity has been achieved provided no Lead objects to the waiver.
If any Lead objects to the action, the vote fails. 

### Referendum Votes

A referendum vote is taken among the project membership. 

Referendum Votes may be set at a majority, a special majority (2/3s of the defined group), or a unanimous vote. The required threshold is set by the Lead making the motion.

In either case, the process is the same as a Majority Leadership Vote or a Unanimous Leadership Vote, except that the target group is considered, not the Leads, and for a special majority vote, two thirds of the voting group must be in favor.

### Extended Final Comment Periods

For all votes held publically, any Lead may make a separate Leadership motion to require a final comment period longer than 24 hours. Any Leadership vote may be used, and the period may be any length of time.
The final comment period for a motion to require an extended final comment period may be waived, provided no Lead objects. 

If an Extended Final Comment Period is used, final votes are checked at the end of the specified period of time, rather than 24 hours, and the vote is otherwise conducted as usual. 

A motion to require an Extended Final Comment Period may be placed at any time prior to ending the final comment period. 

### Conditional Approval

Any Lead may place a condition on their approval of a particular motion, such that their approval is only considered if the condition is met. 

### Formal Dissents

When abstaining or conditionally approving a vote, any Lead (or in the case of a Referendum Vote, any member of the voting group) may lodge a formal dissent, and explain the reason therefore. A Formal Dissent does not block a motion, even one requiring a unanimous vote, but provides reasons that the Lead believes the action should not be taken. 

A Formal Dissent may be for a procedural reason, that the procedures surrounding taking the action were incorrect or some other process should have happened first, or substantive, that the action itself is unnecessary, harmful, or unsound. 

A Formal Dissent may be used by a decision maker to back off of a conflict in posititions that effectively deadlock the LCCC procedures.

## Specific Voting Requirements

Certain actions require specific kinds of votes, and the Lead making the motion must conduct the specified kind of vote for the action.

### Actions Requiring Unanimous Leadership Votes

The following actions may be taken only from a Unanimous Leadership Vote:
* Promotion of any Member to a Lead,
* The termination of any subproject,
* Removal of any Lead from LCCC for serious breach of rules or ethics, except that the Lead who is the subject of the action is considered to have abstained in all circumstances, and
* Amendments to these governance rules.

With the exception of Termination of a subproject, the Lead may presume that a private vote is in the interests of the LCCC Project.
